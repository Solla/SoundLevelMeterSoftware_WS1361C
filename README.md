# Description
Decibel meters are used in several types of measuring instruments. 

**WS1361C** is a cheap decibel meter that provides software interfaces to record surrounding noise level automatically.

Meanwhile, it also provides an interface for calibration to make sure the data is meaningful. 

The sample rate is 1 per second.

Besides, I found that the data read from software has a one-second latency. 

Be aware of the latency when using.

## Usage Scenarios

(Academic Papers) Automatically measure the noise of devices noise if multiple data points are needed.

(Environmental monitoring) Monitoring the surrounding noise level.
